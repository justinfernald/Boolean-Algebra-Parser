# Boolean-Algebra-Parser
A Boolean Algebra Parser I made for a class for fun to solve a very simple problem.

I made this for a class that only wanted a binary adder function and something that spit out truth tables, but I got bored so I made a full boolean algebra expression parser for the fun of it. This was done about a year ago and I thought I would upload it. I also commented every line to make sure people can really understand it. That is a joke, I did it in spite since my instructor said it had to be commented well, so I decided to do that.

So the file contains the parser along with extra bits, so you can take it as an example of how to use it. I don't know why would want to use mine, since I am sure there are already others out there with better documentation.
